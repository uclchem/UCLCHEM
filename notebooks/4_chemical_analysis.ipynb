    "# Chemical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical networks are complex systems where the interplay between many elements often means that small changes in one aspect of the network can greatly effect the outcome in unexpected ways. Nevertheless, there are cases where a simple chemical explanation can be found for some observed behaviour in the model outputs. This tutorial demonstrates how to use some of the functionality of the UCLCHEM library to analyse model outputs and discover these explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do recommend caution when following the approach laid out in this tutorial. There are many pitfalls which we will try to point out as we go. Ultimately, a comprehensive view of how important a reaction is to the outcome of your model requires detailed statistical calculations such as the use of [SHAP values](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) to assign meaningful scores to how much various reactions in a network contribute to a species' abundance. Therefore, care must be taken by the user to ensure that the conclusions they draw from a simpler approach are sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use an example from work that was recently published at the time of writing this tutorial to demonstrate the use of `uclchem.analysis.analysis()` and how it can be used to draw conclusions about the most important reactions in a network for a given species/behaviour."

    "## H3O+ and SO\n",
    "\n",
    "In a piece of inference work in which we measured the cosmic ray ionization rate (CRIR) in NGC 253 [(Holdship et al. 2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220403668H/abstract). We found that both H3O+ and SO were sensitive to the ionization rate. Furthermore, since H3O+ was increased in abundance by increasing CRIR and SO was destroyed, their ratio was extremely sensitive to the rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the work, we present the plot below which shows how the equilibrium abundance of each species changes with the CRIR as well as the ratio. We plot this for a range of temperatures to show that this behaviour is not particularly sensitive to the gas temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![crir_h3o_so_example](./assets/holdship_ngc253.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, this is all the information we need. A complex array of reactions all compete and contribute to produce the outcome of the model. Whatever they are, we see the abundance of these species are very sensitive to the CR over a wide range of temperature and density. However, we can only trust this conclusion as far as we trust the entire chemical network since we don't know what exactly causes this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the analysis function, we may find all of this is driven by a small handful of reactions. The benefit would then be that our trust in our conclusions only depends on how much we trust the rates of those specific reactions. If it is very important, we can evaluate those reactions and readers of our work can make the same decisions as information from experiment changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Generate Test Cases\n",
    "Ideally, we should run a huge grid of models and find some rigorous way to evaluate how important each reaction is to the outcome of the model. However, if we run a small grid representative of different conditions then any simple chemical explanation will be evident if it exists. If it no simple explanation is appropriate, then the analysis module is not appropriate for our task and we could consider more complex approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run a simple grid with all possible combinations of the following:\n",
    "- A low CRIR (zeta=1) and high CRIR (zeta=1e4)\n",
    "- A typical cloud density (n=1e4) and high density (n=1e6)\n",
    "- The lower temperature bound of NGC 253 CMZ (75 K)* and a high temperature (250 K) \n",
    "* The lower boundary is a bit lower, but the computational time of 50K models is a lot longer than 75K so we stick with a bit higher values for speed\n",
    "\n",
    "and that will give us enough to work with for our analysis."

    "\n",
    "Our plan then is to do this for the low zeta case and the high zeta case. Hopefully, we'll see the same reactions are most important to the abundance of $H_3O^+$ and SO at all densities and tempertures.

We can run analysis on $H_2O^+$ to see what is driving that. In fact, as we report in the paper, following this thread we find that a chain of hydrogenations starting from $OH^+$ is the overall route of $H_3O^+$ formation and that this chain starts with small ions that are primarly formed through cosmic ray reactions. *It will very often be the case that analysing one species requires you to run analysis on another.*"

    "## Summary Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've run some representative models to look at why the SO and $H_3O^+$ abundances seem to so heavily depend on the CRIR. We find that a chain of very efficient reactions starting with simple ions comprise the primary formation route of $H_3O^+$ so that the total production of this species depends entirely on the abundance of those ions. With high CRIR, those ions become very abundant and we get a lot of $H_3O^+$ formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SO is complex at first glance since the formation routes vary by parameter. However, looking at the destruction routes we can see that it's simply that SO can be easily destroyed by simple ions and, again, these are very abundant in gas exposed to a high CRIR.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting note about SO is that we could potentially say that destruction via C$^+$ is the dominant destruction route. However, we would caution users to be careful with that kind of statement. Reactions with H$^+$, HE$^+$ and other also destroy SO. It could be that if we turned off the C$^+$ reactions, the SO chemistry would be unchanged as other ions take up the slack. Therefore, unless a single reaction is clearly dominant (as in $H_3O^+$ formation), it is best to test the importance of a reaction by removing it before concluding it is the single most important reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "`uclchem.analysis.analysis()` looks at a snapshot of the gas and calculates the instantaneous rate of change of important reactions. However, over the course of a time step, abundances change and reactions rise and fall in importance. More importantly, complex interplay between reactions can contribute to an outcome. This is ultimately a simple, first order look at what is happening in the network but in many cases, a deeper view will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you struggle to find an explanation that fits all time steps in your outputs and is true across a range of parameters, then it is best not to report simple conclusions about the chemistry and to look for other ways to understand the network."
