    "## A Simple Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "UCLCHEM's `cloud()` model is a spherical cloud of isothermal gas. We can keep a constant density or have it increase over time following a freefall equation. This model is generally useful whenever you want to model a homogeneous cloud of gas under constant conditions. For example, in the inner parts of a molecular cloud where Av $\\gtrsim$ 10 there are very few depth dependent processes. You may wish to model the whole of this UV shielded portion of the cloud with a single `cloud()` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the large number of parameters in a chemical model and the way fortran and python interaction, we find it is easiest to do parameter input through python dictionaries. In this block, we define param_dict which contains the parameters we wish to modify for this run. Every `uclchem.model` function accepts a dictionary as an optional argument. Every parameter has a default value which is overriden if that parameter is specified in this dictionary. You can find a complete list of modifiable parameters and their default values in [our parameter docs](/docs/parameters).\n"

This function returns a dictionary where each entry gives the change in the total abundance of an element as a percentage of the original abundance.

    "\n",
    "Changes of less than 1\\% are fine for many cases but if they are too high, you could consider changing the `reltol` and `abstol` parameters that control the integrator accuracy. They are error tolerance so smaller values lead to smaller errors and (usually) longer integration times. The default values were chosen by running a large grid of models and choosing the tolerances with the lowest average run time from those that conserved elements well and rarely failed. Despite this, there are no one-size-fits-all perfect tolerances and you may run into issues with different networks or models."
