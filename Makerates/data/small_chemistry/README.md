# Small chemistry network
This is a minimum viable astrochemical network that is developed to test basic things in UCLCHEM. It
has only basic gas phase reactions in it, with their respective counterparts on the grain and
the hydrogenation of up to methanol. It is not meant to be used for any science, but it useful
for testing and code development (it also runs a lot quicker than the default UCLCHEM network.)
